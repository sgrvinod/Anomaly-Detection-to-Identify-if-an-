# Anomaly-Detection-using-a-Deep-Learning-Auto-Encoder

Performed Anomaly Detection using a Deep Learning Auto-Encoder (using h2o). 

Trained the Auto-Encoder (2 hidden layer x 400 neurons, Tanh activated) on a bunch of faces, and tested it out on an equal mix of faces and non-faces.

#####Confusion matrix:

**Modeled in R**

###Examples:
